# Grading Requirements

## Overview

RCOS is largely a self-guided class, which can make grading difficult. Instructors
use utilities such as [Observatory](https://rcos.io/) to make turn open source
contributions and community involvement into appropriate grades. The following grading criteria
are designed to help you be successful both as an RCOS student, and as a member of the open source 
community. Generally speaking, if you're contributing to the community and/or making valuable
open-source contributions you'll receive a high grade in RCOS.

## Project Contributions & Planning

### Proposal

Each project must start with a proposal. This proposal will serve as your plan and contract, and should describe a set of well
defined deliverables your team will implement over the course of the semester. 
The suggested number of deliverables is the number of group members times two and each deliverable should have a planned date of completion.
Each team member should contribute to at least 3 deliverables, and multiple team members
can of course collaborate on any given deliverable. These are suggested values and many groups
may find larger numbers to be appropriate based on the size of the team and the scope of the project.

The proposal and deliverables therein must be approved by a mentor at the start of the semester.
However, it is important to remember that the proposal is a living document.
Plans often change, and that is OK. In the event you decide to change your plans for the semester,
or fail to adhere to the timeline set in the proposal, the proposal must be revised
accordingly and the revisions must be approved by a mentor.

### Deliverables

A deliverable is functional increment of your project. For software projects, a deliverable should
typically be a working collection of commits that accomplished a portion of your overall goals.

It is strongly recommended that deliverables be broken down into sub tasks, which should be tracked
using Github Issues. Issues should have well defined acceptance criteria, and should be organized
using Github Projects. 

A deliverable does not necessarily have to a functional change to your project if other work is necessary.
Examples of non-functional deliverables include learning or research goals, significant architectural or
design work, etc.

If a deliverable is not a functional change, there should be a greater focus on documentation
to appropriately convey the work that was done.

Progress for each deliverable must be meticulously documented in one or more blog posts. See
[Blog Posts](#blog-posts) for more information.

If you are not sure how to best divide up your project into deliverables, please ask a mentor for assistance.

## Documentation

Projects should be well documented. Documentation can take many forms. A README and an
OSI approved license are mandatory. The README should include a summary of the project,
instructions for contributing, and any other information needed to develop for and use
the project.

Additional documentation (other than a README and blog posts) is required.
Examples of additional documentation include but are not limited to UML diagrams,
API documents, user manuals, FAQs, setup guides, troubleshooting information, etc.

The use of a wiki is strongly encouraged. Creating a static project site can help you
organize your various forms of documentation and provide excellent exposure for your
project.

If you are unsure how to properly document your project, please consult your mentor for
advice early on.

### Blog Posts

Blog posts should be informative, and are often status updates about your project.
They can also be more general or written in the form of a guide or tutorial. Blog posts
that may help another developer solve a problem that you have solved are extremely valuable
to the open source community. In general you should write blog posts that you would want to 
read and that you would find useful.

Blog posts are also a good way to explain the high level goals of a project, to indicate
that a project is struggling (someone in RCOS might be able to help!) or just
to document tasks that don't fall easily into other categories.

It's a good idea to have a blog post at the beginning of the semester and end of
the semester to indicate what you hope to do, then what you were able to do (or
what you decided to do instead.)

Remember, if the instructor feels that the blog post doesn't add value to the project, if
it's poorly written or very short, it may not be counted. Check with your mentor for blog
post ideas or if you're not sure your blog post is ready for the world!

The minimum requirement for blog posts is one per deliverable plus one at the start and end of
the semester, but you are strongly encouraged to do more. Blog early and blog often!

## Attendance

Being part of the RCOS community means seeing what RCOS members are doing, giving
feedback, and learning from tech talks and guest speakers. Attendence is required
and is taken on Tuesdays and Fridays via observatory.

Unexcused absences can be made up by attending bonus sessions. Generally bonus
sessions are unique, long or workshop-style tech talks, a RCOS hackathon, or an
optional RCOS session. Pay attention in the large group meeting to hear bonus
sessions announced.

A student can have two unexcused absences before their grade is affected or make-ups are needed.

## Presentations

Each project group is required to give one large group presentation. Presentations should be
well prepared and rehearsed in the presence of a mentor for feedback.
See [rcos presentations](http://rcos.github.io/intro/presentations#/) for more details.

### Tech Talks & Bonus Sessions

In addition to the large group project presentation, each member is required to either give
one large group tech talk, host a bonus session, or alternatively attend a bonus session.
Upperclassmen and more senior members are encouraged to give tech talks for the benefit of the RCOS community.
All members are encouraged to attend bonus sessions. A bonus session attended in lieu of
hosting a bonus session or giving a tech talk cannot also count as an attendence makeup.

## External Contribution

Contribute to something outside of RCOS or help out another group with an issue! External contributions 
are encouraged as it allows RCOS to give back to the larger open source community. The project you're
contributing to should be used by a significant number of people outside of RPI.  

Within RCOS, we also want to generate a community of helping other projects and making your project more 
friendly to outside contributors. If you're doing your external contributions to another RCOS project, it 
must be a project that you have not previouly worked on and you must communicate with the project through 
Github issues, PRs, and code reviews.

External contributions are strongly encouraged but are not required. With the approval of a mentor,
a significant external contribution can take the place of a single [deliverable requirement](#deliverables).

# How Grades are Calculated

Although RCOS is a team sport, grading is done on the individual member. Make sure you meet the requirements,
including the requirements on the project itself such as the README, License and other forms of documentation.

**If you find this rubric to be incompatible with your project, or you believe that it will significantly
hinder or not acurately represent your progress, please let us know as adjustments and exceptions can be made.**
